 This project was created Fall 2020. This project is a user interactive game where the user is portrayed as a duck. User can utilize the < and > arrow keys to move left and right and the space key to jump. The user can click on a target to have the duck attack by shooting back. The object of this game is to avoid being shot by the hunters while moving through the levels.

- Math Anxiety
  Fall 2017 - Spring 2018 I worked on a year long project studying math anxiety and how elementary level educators can prevent this issue from developing. My research included analyzing academic papers, interviews with professors, educators and math anxiety experts, and field research at East Farms Elementary School in Farmington, CT.
